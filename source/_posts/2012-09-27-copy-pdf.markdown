I often get asked how to copy the text out of protected PDFs in Windows.
Authors can mark their PDFs as protected to apply certain restrictions like commenting or copying.
But not all Readers care about them. There are a lot of old Readers that allow you to copy.

The default PDF-Reader in Ubuntu doesn't care as well and easily lets you copy the content.
So go and get [Evince for Windows](https://live.gnome.org/Evince/Downloads).
